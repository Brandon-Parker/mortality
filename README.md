Our team project is a mad-lib to 'predict' your death. It is not for children. The stories were written complete, and we later determined which words would make the stories the most ridiculous as possible when replaced with random nouns, verbs, or adjectives.
We put together a function that would allow the mad-libs to be filled in by the user input that would transfer the input from local storage on the front page to the results page and populate the correct empty array with each word submitted.
The project was made almost entirely through pair programming (and sometimes quad-programming) and a ton of high quality communication through each step. Some things were harder than others, which is where the quad-programming happened, and other parts were perfectly fine to complete in pairs. Overall, I'd say our biggest advantage this week was communication with every single step.
