    "rambunctious": "It was a dark and stormy night. You realize with a sense of urgency that you havent {{verb1}} yet! You look close to the door of your shadow-filled home and see your {{noun1}}. Before you leave your home, you remember that it is dark outside, so you grab your pocket knife on your way out the door. During your {{adj1}} walk through the wind and rain, you feel your {{noun2}} {{verb2}} in your pocket, and you decide to check and see if it is a {{adj2}} message. As you pull your {{noun3}} out to look, you somehow manage to open your pocket knife inside your pocket. You unlock your {{adj3}} phone screen and miss seeing the bump in the {{noun3}} and you fall forward with all your bodyweight, letting go of your {{noun1}} to catch yourselfâ€¦ And your pocket knife {{verb3}} your femoral artery as your {{noun1}} lands on your head, knocking you unconscious, leaving you to bleed out while drowning in a puddle."

    "insane": "It was a dark and stormy night. You hear a {{adj1}} sound on the window but dont think anything of it at first assuming that it is just a {{noun1}} scraping on the glass... And then pure darkness--the power is out. Suddenly, you can see the outline of a {{noun2}} outside your window... or so it seems. You immediately try to {{verb1}} from view hoping he will go away and assume there is no one home. You find a dark corner to hide in and wait... when the {{noun2}} suddenly disappears into thin air! You gladly breathe a sigh of relief and then a {{adj2}} scream as something starts to loudly {{verb2}} on your door! Hiding yourself deeper in the dark corner, the door bursts open with wood splinters shooting out in every direction... and one long piece of the {{verb3}} door particles gets lodged in your throat, spraying blood all around your body, revealing your location to the {{adj3}} red-eyed blood-thirsty beast. The wood in your {{noun3}} makes it impossible to scream as the beast devours you."

    "apathetic": "It was a dark and stormy night. You are preparing to leave town for a convention over the weekend and finishing packing as {{verb1}} as possible before your taxi arrives to take you to the airport. As you are zipping up your suitcase, you hear a {{adj1}} car horn from your {{noun1}} and quickly run toward the door. Before you run outside, you decide to bring a scarf and gloves to {{verb2}} the storm outside, wrapping your scarf around your neck as {{adj2}} as possible and run outside, you slip on the rainslicked wood paneled porch and landing flat on your back. Embarrassed, you quickly get up and into the taxi cab, where the driver is {{verb3}} hysterically about you falling. Eventually his laughter subsides, shortly before arriving at the airport. You grab your {{noun2}} and get out of the taxi to walk into the airport... but you turned around too fast and didnt notice that your {{adj3}} scarf is closed in the car door. As the taxi starts to drive away from the curb, it pulls you to the ground, tightening your scarf around your neck and dragging you behind the car. Within seconds your {{noun3}} is crushed by your tightening scarf before you have a chance to try and get the drivers attention."

    "bearded": "It was a dark and stormy night. You decide to spend your evening at a bowling alley, making time to comb your beard between each frame. The bowling ball return has a chrome base, allowing you to use it for a mirror so you can admire your beard as often as possible. The reflection of your magnificent beard is mesmerizing and you are so transfixed by it that you trip on the step up to the lane. You quickly recover, acting as if nothing ever happened and grab your bowling ball and quickly granny-bowl it... because tripping in front of people wasnt embarrassing enough for you. Congratulations! It isnt a gutter ball! You manage to knock over the 10 pin. Just the 10 pin. You wait for your ball to return to you for your second try at knocking pins down, but it doesnt seem to be coming back. Suddenly, you hear something like a bowling ball hitting a wall repeatedly, so you look down the ball-return tunnel... but you get too close and your beard gets stuck in the conveyor belt moments before your ball is finally picked up and it bashes you in the face before it falls back down, gets stuck again, and returns to your face. You are now a bloody mess and twitching until your last breath. Thoughts? Hopes? Dreams? Desires? Not any more..."

    "bored": "It was a dark and stormy night. You were {{verb1}} around doing nothing, waiting for something {{adj1}} to happen, when your phone starts ringing. You pick it up, figuring it must be a {{noun1}} since no one ever calls you. When you say 'hello?', all you hear from the other end of the call is a deep {{adj2}} sound. It must be a kid prank calling... So you hang up and go back to doing a whole lot of nothing. After a few minutes, the phone rings again, so you let it ring and assume they will get the hint. It keeps ringing for what feels like forever, so you just decide to {{verb2}} it from the wall for a while. You sit back down for a few minutes... and then it starts ringing again! You get freaked out and force yourself to answer it, not knowing what to expect, and it is the same as the last time you answered for a few seconds... and then you hear a {{noun2}} voice say to you: 'Youre going to die soon. You should probably {{verb3}} your farewells soon.' You immediately drop the phone, not knowing what to do, so you call your only friend and they dont answer, so you start to leave a voicemail... when your {{noun3}} bursts into flame mid-sentence, killing you {{adj3}}."

You {{verb1}} outside into the {{adj1}} rain and head toward your car, but you dont make it very far before you {{verb2}} on the wet {{noun2}}. Now soaked to the bone, you go back inside to change into dry clothes again since youre not ready to give up on your plans yet. The second attempt was {{adj2}} successful so you start your car and head out to meet up with your friend. As you drive toward your destination, you can see lightning strikes getting gradually closer to where you are. Suddenly, the lightning hits the {{noun3}} right in front of your car, so you {{verb3}} on the brakes and hope for the best. You didnt think about the car behind yours, which then crashes into the back of your car, knocking your head into the steering wheel, rendering you dazed and {{adj3}}. Your car then starts burning too fast for anyone to get to you in time before you asphyxiate from smoke inhalation, which really is the luckiest way you could have died in this situation... No one wants to be burned alive."
